A simple file-sorter with some built-in customization. Also provided is a Append/Prepend file name editor. Originally created to automate filesorting for document archival.

Has a somewhat robust error checking system with plenty of descriptive warnings. It is somewhat difficult to break, but I'm sure its possible.

Eventually, I'd love to do a re-write and re-organization to use functions so the code is a bit cleaner. I really wanted to challenge myself to do a script with NO functions and NO gotos.
