A simple file-sorter with some built-in customization. Also provided is a Append/Prepend file name editor. Originally created to automate filesorting for document archival.

Eventually, it would be nice to convert this into a full-featured and customizable filesorter, but for right now directories and top-level categories are hard-coded and it does very little to FULLY prevent errors. There is somewhat of a robust warning system -- but for the program to work correctly, the user will have to use it correctly.
